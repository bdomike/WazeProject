#**Hypotheses:**
#$H_0$: There is no difference in average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and drivers who use Androids.
#$H_A$: There is a difference in average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and drivers who use Androids.

# 1. Isolate the `drives` column for iPhone users.
iPhone = df[df['device_type'] == 1]['drives']

# 2. Isolate the `drives` column for Android users.
Android = df[df['device_type'] == 2]['drives']

# 3. Perform the t-test
stats.ttest_ind(a=iPhone, b=Android, equal_var=False)

#Based on these results, the p-value is 0.1433, which is greater than the chosen significance level of 5%. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and we can confirm with 95% confidence that there is no difference between number of drives based on device type.
